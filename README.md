# 2VTT
It's a simple subtitle converter based on PyQt5 and Python 3.6
It converts .srt subs to .vtt format.

To use this app launch "2VTT.py" with "python .../2VTT.py" 
(You can also build a standalone app with py2app or py2exe.It's simplier to use, but file'll be large)

To add files for conversions drag the file from file manager and drop it into the 2VTT's window (doesn't support folders for now).
