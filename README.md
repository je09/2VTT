# 2VTT
It's a simple subtitle converter based on PyQt5 and Python 3.6. 

Thats why it **requires PyQt5** 

You can install it with "**pip install PyQt5**"

# Usage
To convert .srt (more formats soon) subs to .vtt format.

Launch "2VTT.py" with terminal command "python .../2VTT.py" 
(You can also build a standalone app with py2app or py2exe.It's simplier to use, but file'll be large)
(I'll upload standalone app for Mac soon)

To add files for conversions drag it from your file manager and drop into the 2VTT's window (doesn't support folders for now).

After adding everything you wanted. Just click "Convert it!".
Converted files will appers in the same folder with same name, but in ".vtt" format.
